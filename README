A Gallery2 scraper.  Caches pages locally, writes metadata to sqlite3 table.
Work-in-progress.

Site.py should define these constants:
  BASE_URL = 'http://mygallery.example.com/gallery/path/to/album/'
  ALBUM_NAME = 'Name of album to scrape'
Adjust for your site and the particular album you want to scrape.

Thanks to gameguy43 whose code got me started.
